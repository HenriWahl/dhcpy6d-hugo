The DHCPv6 server **dhcpy6d** now has a new home: [https://dhcpy6d.de](https://dhcpy6d.de).

It is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) in its own [repository](https://github.com/HenriWahl/dhcpy6d-jekyll) made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

The move has consequences for the URLs in the **Debian** and **CentOS** repository - please check them at [https://dhcpy6d.de/download](https://dhcpy6d.de/download). Due to changed signing keys there would have been trouble even if the URLs were redirected so the decision was made to do a hard cut.
