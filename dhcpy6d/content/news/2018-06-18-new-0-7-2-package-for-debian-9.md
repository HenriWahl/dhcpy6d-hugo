As solution for issue [https://github.com/HenriWahl/dhcpy6d/issues/14](https://github.com/HenriWahl/dhcpy6d/issues/14) there is a new package for Debian uploaded for dhcpy6d 0.7.2. This package is built on Debian 9 and not only suggests but depends on package python-dns. This way an installation on a fresh machine throws no error due to missing python-dns.


Get it at [/download](/download).
