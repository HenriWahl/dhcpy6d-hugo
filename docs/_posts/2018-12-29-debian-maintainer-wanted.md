We need a new maintainer for the [Debian package](https://packages.debian.org/sid/dhcpy6d) of dhcpy6d, because it currently is a little bit outdated. This situation will not change soon, because the current maintainer Axel won’t do it further – but thanks for all work done so far!


If you know Debian packaging or like it or know somebody who does and want to help a little project see details at the [dhcpy6d orphanage page](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=905014).
